This is the source code for the PaleoSpinner Xcode project. This was one of the first apps I ever wrote and I haven't looked at it in a long time so I have no idea what state it's in. It should run fine as I've never gotten any crash reports, but that doesn't mean it's good code!

The app was designed specifically for a friend and did exactly what it was supposed to, however it received very poor reviews on the App Store. Since it's gone to being a free app, I figured I'd post the code here for anyone to look at.

Remember, this was one of the first apps I ever did and I can almost guarantee you shouldn't do things the way I did them in here! 

Enjoy!
